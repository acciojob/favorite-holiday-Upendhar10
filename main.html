	<h1>Sikkim - Gangtok</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
		Incredibly alluring, pleasantly boisterous and wreathed in clouds – Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim, is one of the most popular hill stations in India.
		Lying at the height of 1650 m above sea level, the town offers spectacular views of Mt. Kanchenjunga on clear days.
		It serves as a base for adventure lovers, especially trekkers and campers exploring the Himalayan ranges.
